# AutonomyAI-Pepper
This project aims to enable the robot Pepper, from SoftBank Robotics, to make autonomous decisions using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. Pepper will be able to analyze sensory data from the environment, process the received information, and execute autonomous actions based on its built-in decision-making system.
