#### Pepper Robot Humanoid - Autonomous Decision-Making System

#### Description:
This project aims to enable the robot Pepper, from SoftBank Robotics, to make autonomous decisions using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. Pepper will be able to analyze sensory data from the environment, process the received information, and execute autonomous actions based on its built-in decision-making system.

#### Features:
- Implementation of Decision-Making Algorithms
- Integration of Artificial Intelligence Services
- Reception and Processing of Sensory Data
- Execution of Autonomous Actions
- Cycle of Learning and Continuous Improvement

#### Technologies Used:
- Python
- qi Library for interacting with Pepper
- OpenAI or other artificial intelligence service
- Artificial Intelligence Algorithms
- GitHub for version control and collaboration
